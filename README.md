# Sign-Language-CNN-Model
This project focuses on building a deep learning model for image classification. The goal is to create a neural network that can accurately predict different hand signs images. In this specific case, we are using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images into 10 different classes.
## Result
The model achieved an accuracy of 90.33% on the validation dataset. It demonstrates its effectiveness in accurately classifying images.
