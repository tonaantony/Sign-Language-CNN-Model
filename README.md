# Sign-Language-CNN-Model
This project focuses on building a deep learning model for image classification. The goal is to create a neural network that can accurately predict different hand signs images. In this specific case, we are using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images into 10 different classes.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of images categorized into 10 classes. Each class corresponds to a different object or category. The dataset is organized into subfolders where each subfolder represents a class, and it contains images of that class.
